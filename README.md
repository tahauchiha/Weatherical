## Motivation Behind the Project :
<I>Pressure, Dew Point, UV Index, Moon Phase.....Do we need to know all this when checking the weather conditions of our area? Do these affect the life of common people like us? No, right! Then why should we overcomplicate our weather applications , making them difficult for people to navigate and acquire the essential information.</I> <br><br>
WeatherMuse aims at changing this situation by providing with a minimalistic and user-friendly way for people to access real-time weather information for any location in the world. Its purpose is to provide a convenient alternative to other weather apps that may be cluttered or difficult to navigate.
